# Bookstore System
Wrote a Bookstore system in Python, where it allows the users to add any given book from a collection of over 200 books to their shopping cart using either infix, prefix, or key.
It also allows the user to search for books using the same method above and will display all the books that correspond with the userâ€™s input.
Built-in a system where it allows the users to sort the books in the shopping cart using Merge Sort or Quicksort.
