Question 4 Binary Tree:

Advantage of Binary Search Trees over Hash Tables: 
	- Binary Search Tree is faster than Hash Table at insertion and deletion
	- Range queries such as sorting, is simpler to execute.
	- Binary Search Tree structures have easy and efficient implementation.
	- BST can guarantee insertion, retrieve and deletion because it never meets collision.

Disadvantage of Binary Search Trees over Hash Tables:
	- Hash Table is more effective and apperant when there is a large data set.
	- Compare to BST, Hash Table is siginificantly simpler to implement
	- During operations, Hash Tables take up less memory
	- Hash Table does not maiintain a total order of insertions because it doesn't need to.
